# How to contribute

Want to get involved with *ROCK*HARBOR's software development? Great, we need
you! Here's a quick guide to contributing:

1. Fork the repo
2. Work on a branch for your feature (say `ticket-12`)
3. Push that branch to your fork
4. Submit a pull request using your branch against our `dev` branch

After that, we'll review your change. If all goes well it'll be merged into `dev`
and eventually `master`, where it will make it onto the production site!

## Syntax

Below is a brief syntax style guide. While these aren't strict requirements for
contributing, they make the review process go by much faster.

1. Tabs, not spaces
2. No trailing whitespace
3. Unix line endings
4. Follow conventions that already exist in the repo

**Do not follow WordPress' syntax guidelines (i.e., leaving out braces, 'yoda'
conditions, extra spaces around parens, etc.**
